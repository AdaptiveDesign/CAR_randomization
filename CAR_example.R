# Modifications to existing functions from:
# ------------------------------------------------
# The 'Minirand' R package version 0.1.3, originally developed by Man Jin, Adam Polis, 
# and Jonathan Hartzel, was used as a starting point for further development. 
# Original source code can be found at: https://github.com/cran/Minirand
# This software is distributed under the MIT License.
#
# Changes implemented in this version:
# - Implemented probability allocation methods as described by Pocock, S. J., & Simon, R. 
#   in their paper "Sequential treatment assignment with balancing for prognostic factors 
#   in the controlled clinical trial".
# - Modifications to the original 'Minirand' code to accommodate scenarios 
#   with a single factor randomization, enhancing its applicability to a broader 
#   range of clinical trial designs.
#
# Hierarchical Dynamic Balancing Randomization:
# ------------------------------------------------
# The 'Hierarchical Dynamic Balancing' randomization algorithm implemented in our code
# is inspired by the design developed in the paper by Heritier, S., Gebski, V., & Pillai, A.,
# titled 'Dynamic balancing randomization in controlled clinical trials'.
# 
# We have also developed 'Complete Randomization', 'Stratified Permuted Block 
# Randomization', and 'Stratified Big Stick Design' for comparison.
#
# The foundational work by the aforementioned authors is acknowledged as a significant contribution
# to the field. Our code represents an academic endeavor to operationalize their proposed designs
# into practical, executable algorithms, while also introducing novel adaptations.
